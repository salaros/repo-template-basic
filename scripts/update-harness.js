// scripts/update-harness.js
// Installs this repository's harness into another one, and updates it there afterwards. The
// upstream keeps moving; a repo made from it fills the same tree with work of its own. This script
// is the line between the two, and scripts/harness-files.tsv is where that line is written down.
//
// Updating is a three-way merge, not a copy. harness-lock.json at the target root records the
// upstream commit the harness was last taken from, so an update has a base: the recorded commit's
// version of a file, the target's version, and the new one. A file nobody edited takes the new
// version outright. An edited one keeps its edits and gains the changes around them. Only a real
// collision is written with conflict markers, and every one of those is reported and exits 1, so a
// half-merged harness is never mistaken for a clean update.
//
// First run into a repo with no harness-lock.json is an install: there is no base, so every managed
// file is written, and nothing that already exists is touched.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/update-harness.js                     update this repo from the upstream it records
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --dry-run           say what would change, write nothing
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --ref v2            update from a tag or branch instead
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --target ../other   install into or update another checkout
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --from ../ai-harness use a checkout you already have, no clone
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --astro-docs        add tools/docs-site, the Astro renderer for the chain
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --no-check          install without proving it afterwards
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --quiet             the summary alone, no line per path
//   node scripts/update-harness.js --adopt             take every harness file from the upstream, losing local edits
// Installing into a repo that has no harness yet, from anywhere:
//   git clone https://github.com/salaros/ai-harness .harness && \
