// scripts/check-todo.js
// Keeps TODO.md greppable, and valid against the todo-md standard (https://github.com/todo-md/todo-md):
// a `# TODO` header, one-line tasks starting `- [ ] `, metadata as `#tag` and `@user`, subtasks by
// indentation. The `loose-ends` skill records what has nowhere else to live -- a question nobody
// answered, an assumption taken on trust, work knowingly left -- and a ledger only pays for itself
// if every entry can be found by its tag.
// One rule departs from the standard on purpose. todo-md keeps finished work as `- [x]` done or
// `- [-]` declined; here a resolved entry is deleted in the commit that resolves it. Kept entries
// are noise every agent re-reads on every run, and the file's length stops meaning anything. An
// all-open file is still valid todo-md, so its tooling reads this one; it just never sees the other
// two states.
// Only checkbox lines are entries; every other line is prose the file is free to carry. It never
// asks for entries to exist: an empty ledger, or no TODO.md at all, is the honest state of a repo
// with nothing outstanding.
// Called by .githooks/pre-commit, which pipes the staged blob in, so the check sees what the commit
// will record rather than what is on disk. Reads a path instead when given one.
// Usage:
//   git show :TODO.md | node scripts/check-todo.js
//   node scripts/check-todo.js TODO.md
