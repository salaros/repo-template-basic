## Scripts

Automation scripts for working with this repository. They are run by
developers and CI, not by the application itself, and are never shipped as
part of the product.

### What belongs here

- **Setup** — bootstrap a fresh clone (install dependencies, git hooks,
  local configuration).
- **Build and release** — compile, package, version, publish.
- **Maintenance** — clean caches, regenerate code or docs, migrate data.
- **CI helpers** — steps invoked from pipeline definitions, kept here so
  they can also be run locally.

### Conventions

- One task per script, named after what it does (`githooks-init.js`,
  `build.js`, `release.js`); Node, so they run the same on every OS.
- Scripts are safe to run from any working directory — each resolves the
  repository root from its own location.
- Every script starts with a short comment describing what it does and how
  to call it; scripts that take arguments print usage when run with `-h`.
- Node, so scripts run the same on Linux, macOS and Windows without a shell
  adapter; `.githooks/post-merge` is the one exception, since Git always
  runs it through its own bundled shell.
- Scripts must be idempotent where possible — running them twice should not
  break anything.
