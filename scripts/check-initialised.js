// and every skill that reads them guesses while it is missing, so the `project-init` skill is meant
// to run before anything else. This is what makes that an order rather than a suggestion.
// The escape hatch is an empty `.skip-project-init` at the repo root: untracked and ignored, so it
// is per clone and never travels. The template's own repo needs it, having no project to configure.
// Called by .githooks/pre-commit and .githooks/pre-push, which pass the action for the last line.
// A hook is a local courtesy, not a wall: `--no-verify` skips it, and hooks run at all only after
// `node scripts/githooks-init.js`. It stops the honest mistake, which is the one worth stopping.
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-initialised.js [commit|push]

Missing: ${r.missing.join(", ")}

Run the project-init skill first (/project-init in Claude Code). It asks for
those facts and writes ${FACTS}, the README and docs/agents/issue-tracker.md.

If this clone has no project to configure -- the template's own repo, say --
create an empty ${MARKER} at the root. Git ignores it, so it stays yours.

To ${action} anyway: git ${action} --no-verify
