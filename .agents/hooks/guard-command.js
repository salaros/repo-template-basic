// Refuses destructive shell commands before the harness runs them. Reads the harness's hook
// payload from stdin, takes the actual command text via lib.commandText (falling back to the raw
// payload only when the shape is unrecognised), and matches each rule only where it could be a
// real invocation: at the start of the text or right after a shell operator (&&, ||, ;, |, a
// newline or an open paren). A dangerous phrase quoted as data inside another command's own
// arguments (`printf '...git push --force...'`) sits after none of those and is not matched;
// text in an unrelated payload field never reaches the match at all.
// Exit 2 = block, reason on stderr. Exit 0 = allow.
// Wire it to the pre-tool-use event of the shell tool (README, "Files per AI tool").

// A token ends at a space, a JSON escape (backslash), the closing quote, or end of line.
