description: Verify and repair the documentation chain under docs/. Use after writing or editing any BRD, PRD, EARS, BDD, ADR or SPEC document, after changing MEMORY.md's Requirements line, when a citation such as PRD-0002/FR-3 looks wrong, or when asked whether the docs are traceable.

# Docs check

The chain in `AGENTS.md` ("Documentation") only pays off when every document can be walked back to the business need. `scripts/docs-check.js` verifies that mechanically: file names give IDs, first headings carry them, every document says what it was derived from, and every citation resolves to an existing document or item earlier in the chain. `MEMORY.md`'s `Requirements` line is checked the same way, because it is the entry point to the chain.

## Steps

1. Run it from the repo root:

   ```bash
   node scripts/docs-check.js
   ```

   Done when you have the full list of problems, one per line, or the line saying there are none.

2. **Repair** each problem in the document it names, never by deleting the citation:
   - a missing or wrong first heading: make it `# <ID>: <title>` where the ID comes from the file name (`docs/ears/0003-x.md` is `EARS-0003`);
   - a missing `**Derived from:**` line: add it under the heading, citing the upstream document IDs;
   - a `**Derived from:**` line naming no reference: put a real one on it. Upstream document IDs where the chain has them, otherwise a source, meaning a URL, a repo-relative path that exists, or `jira:KEY-123`. Prose alone does not count, and a path that is not there is reported by name;
   - a source-only line where an upstream document exists: the named document was written after this one, so cite it instead. This is the message you get after adding a BRD behind an existing PRD;
   - a `Requirements` line in `MEMORY.md` that names nothing valid: give it sources, comma-separated, or the BRD's ID once one exists;
   - a citation to a document that does not exist: find the intended file and fix the number, or write the missing upstream document first;
   - a citation to a missing item: add the ID to the item's line in the upstream document (`- FR-3: …`) if the item exists without an ID, otherwise fix the reference;
   - a forward citation: the document is citing a later stage; move that content downstream or drop the reference. An ADR is exempt in both directions, so this never fires on one.

   Done when the script prints "no problems".

3. Report what you changed, per file.
